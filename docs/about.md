# About

I'm Billy Zoellers, a Lexington, KY based IT Infrastructure Consultant constantly striving to learn more about automation, security, and routing/switching.

I attended [Transylvania University](https://transy.edu) for my Computer Science degree, and I currently work for a Cisco Premier Partner, [Dean Dorton](https://deandorton.com).

I hold certifications from Cisco and VMware. Most recently I have found myself interested in network automation. I love the idea that I can sit on the fence between traditional network engineering and software development to build solutions.
